    "github.com/Checkmarx/containers-types/types"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    extractor := imagesExtractor.ImagesExtractor{}
    scanPath := "/path/to/scan"

    // Extract files
    files, envVars, extractedPath, err := extractor.ExtractFiles(scanPath)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error extracting files: %v", err)
    }

    // Merge images
    images, err := extractor.ExtractAndMergeImagesFromFiles(files, []types.ImageModel{}, envVars)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error merging images: %v", err)
    }

    // Save to file
    err = extractor.SaveObjectToFile(extractedPath, images)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error saving images to file: %v", err)
